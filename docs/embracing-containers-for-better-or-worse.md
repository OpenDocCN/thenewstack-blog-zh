# Microservices and the Rush to Become the Standard Bearer

> 原文：<https://thenewstack.io/embracing-containers-for-better-or-worse/>

The following two episodes of [The New Stack Makers](/tag/the-new-stack-makers/) podcast were taken from the show floor at DockerCon 2016, held last month in Seattle. We interview reps from microservices software provider [Datawire](https://www.datawire.io/) and infrastructure management software provider [RackN](https://rackn.com/).

In the first interview, [Rob Hirschfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhirschfeld) discussed how Docker’s fast-track toward its goal of becoming the new standard for containers may have also led to an irreparable rift in the developer community.

The conversation [may also be heard on YouTube](https://youtu.be/w5_Zud5o_PI).

There has been recent discussion not only of a [possible Docker fork](https://thenewstack.io/docker-fork-talk-split-now-table/), but of how Docker speaks about and to the [community it claims to represent](https://thenewstack.io/for-open-source-software-foundations-are-the-new-cathedrals/).

Rather than a communal sense of accomplishment, Docker’s enthusiasm surrounding the announcements made at DockerCon 2016 seemed presented in a self-congratulatory fashion, rather than about celebrating the community as a whole, Hirschfeld charged.

“It really is a dilemma. Docker wants to move quickly, they want to own the brand, but they also want to have a very vibrant ecosystem. There really is a tension between what Docker perceives its users want (…) and then the ecosystem around it where vendors say ‘Well, we’re going to use these tools and we want to be a part of it,’” Hirschfeld said. “I think it’s very problematic when one vendor has a very strong voice and is cannibalizing the ecosystem.”

RackN focuses on allowing users the ability to create their own hands-off hybrid infrastructure, tooled to their unique use cases. RackN focuses on getting developers away from micromanaging their stack, and back to writing code.

When discussing how developers work with containers at scale, though, Hirschfeld is uneasy. “I’m scared we’re just glossing over this again. That we’re papering over the, ‘All right, operating this stuff is actually hard,’” Hirschfeld said. “You have to understand how security works to make sure you have a trusted relationship between components so that you can manage it. I think there’s a lot of pieces we’re still wishing away that aren’t really gone.”

在下面嵌入的另一个采访中，Datawire 社区开发者 [Austin Gunter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austingunter) 和 Datawire 高级软件工程师 [Phil Lombardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/plombardi89) 描述了微服务和 [Datawire](https://www.datawire.io/) 的支持工具包如何帮助开发者简化他们的工作流程。

虽然当今许多企业都在考虑转向基于微服务的方法，但他们可能不确定如何拆除原有的基础架构。应该先将整块材料中的哪一块分解成微服务？大规模运营时，您如何管理服务发现？

Datawire 希望帮助开发者实现的是在运营相关的系统管理上花更少的时间，花更多的时间编码。“这意味着基本上给人们一个易于使用的工具包。当你想到开发人员时，他们想要代码。开发人员不想考虑如何扩展和操作微服务环境运行所需的实际基础设施。Lombardi 说:“给他们一行 API，让他们可以使用，并找出这些微服务在哪里共存。

虽然有许多企业可能希望成为下一个网飞或谷歌，通过微服务来运行他们的整个基础设施，但 Datawire 希望其他公司通过在整个生态系统中分享轶事和最佳实践来实现类似的可扩展性水平。

“有些公司正在考虑采用微服务，但并不是每个人都有资源来构建这样做所需的所有基础设施。“Datawire 正在做的事情之一是为已经大规模这样做的人收集真实世界的建议，”冈特解释说。

Docker 是新堆栈的赞助商。
