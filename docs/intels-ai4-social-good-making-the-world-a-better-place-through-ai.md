[Intel’s AI4Good: Good News for a Change](https://thenewstack.simplecast.com/episodes/intels-ai4good-good-news-for-a-change)

“There’s so much passion for using AI in ways that are beneficial,” said [Anna Bethke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabethke/), Head of Intel’s [AI4 Social Good](https://www.intel.ai/ai4socialgood) project at Intel’s AI Products Group, in our latest episode of [The New Stack Makers podcast](/podcasts/makers).

Bethke’s team partners with companies and social justice organizations to give them access to Intel’s knowledge of deep learning skills and techniques, making it easier for them to mine social media and other data to filter out the noise.

One of her first partnerships is with the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/home) (NCMEC). Its mission is to find children who are being trafficked or in danger of being kidnapped and alert the local law enforcement so they can take action.

NCMEC gets hundreds of thousands of alerts a day from social media like Facebook and Twitter, which was completely unmanageable. Leveraging the expertise of the people at NCMEC, Bethke built algorithms using keywords and phrases to flag possible social media posts, identify where the post originated, and prioritize the danger level. The data from the social media sites is set to cull every possibility and AI is the perfect tool for separating an awkward social post from a real threat.

There are three points of information NCMEC needs. First, it needs to identify and prioritize which posts represent the most danger to the child. Second, it needs to identify where the post is originating, which is often complicated by the use of multiple IP addresses and IP address obscuring. Once the location is found, the legal jurisdiction needs to be identified so the information can be sent to the proper authorities (e.g., police or sheriff department). But how do you find that information in the flood of data?

Enter the AI4 Social Good team. It built an on-premises, scaleable AI system that is completely self-contained. The data is so sensitive, that none of it is in the cloud or was even transferred to any Intel system for testing.

The project also built-in ways to search the dark web, which is where a lot of the child trafficking takes place. It added the dark web data, along with the data gathered from social media into NCMEC’s AI system.

另一个问题是确定照片中人的年龄，这与执法部门可以采取什么行动有很大关系。面部识别，特别是在全球范围内，仍处于起步阶段，Bethke 指出，大多数人工智能面部识别训练计划在其训练指南中只有白人成年男性。该程序的这一部分正在发展，并将面部识别与帖子的文本相结合，以确定可能的年龄。

在这个过程中，Bethke 希望让英特尔内外的其他人更容易参与进来。她的人工智能开发者项目现在非常受欢迎，以至于项目在她不知情的情况下就开始了。她最近听说一名英特尔开发人员编写了一个识别西藏货币的手机应用程序，以便盲人可以知道他们有多少钱。
